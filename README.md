# **Basic ML Model for Real Estate Prediction using Python**
This project is the final requirement for IBM's Analyzing Data with Python course. The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the market price of a house based on various features. By analyzing key attributes such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of floors, the project provides insights into the factors that most influence housing prices.

## **Project Overview**
This project involves the following key steps:

### **1. Importing the Dataset**
The dataset is imported and prepared for analysis. It includes various features related to real estate properties, such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, etc.

### **2. Data Wrangling**
Data wrangling is performed to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for modeling. This includes:
* Identifying and Handling Missing Values: Detecting any missing data and deciding on the appropriate methods to handle them.
* Correcting Data Formats: Ensuring that all data types are consistent and correctly formatted.
* Data Standardization and Normalization: Transforming data into a standard format and scaling the features to improve model performance.
  
### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA is conducted to explore and visualize the relationships between the different features in the dataset. This step involves:
* Analyzing Individual Feature Patterns: Using visualizations to understand the distribution and relationship of features.
* Descriptive Statistical Analysis: Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.
* Correlation Analysis: Assessing the strength and direction of the relationships between features.
  
### **4. Model Development**
A Multiple Linear Regression model is developed to predict housing prices based on the selected features. This step involves:
* Building the Regression Model: Using the cleaned and prepared dataset to train the model.
  
### **5. Model Evaluation and Refinement** 
The model is evaluated and refined to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This involves:
* Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.
* Ridge Regression: Applying Ridge Regression to improve model performance by addressing multicollinearity.
  
## **Tools and Technologies**
* Programming Language: Python
* Interactive Programming Tool: Jupyter Notebook
* Data Manipulation and Analysis: Pandas, Numpy
* Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
* Data Modelling and Evaluation: Scikit-learn

## **Conclusion**
This project provides a comprehensive approach to developing a basic machine learning model for real estate price prediction. By following the steps outlined above, you can replicate the process and gain insights into how various features affect housing prices. The model developed serves as a foundation for further refinement and can be expanded with more complex algorithms and additional features.
